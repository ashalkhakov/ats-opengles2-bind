This directory contains an ATS binding to OpenGL ES, version 2.0.

The binding is structured in such a way as to be as close as possible
to the C API. The most notable difference is that some OpenGL ES resources
("names") are given linear types to help programmer reason about resource
leaks.

The binding is not safe in the following sense: type signatures of some
functions admit programs which can corrupt memory. In particular,
the use of [glVertexAttribPointer] has to be done with some care:
make sure that the array supplied via this function to OpenGL
is *not* deallocated until [glDisableVertexAttrib] is issued.

Additionally, I could not, as of yet, find a good way to specifying
interleaved arrays for OpenGL.

The documentation is mostly absent at this point. However, you may find
examples in the [TEST] subdirectory useful. The examples are intended
to be both informative and more-or-less realistic.

At the time of writing, the examples only work against the OpenGL ES 2.0
implementation as is available with Mesa on X11/GLX. Porting these programs
to another platform should not pose too much difficulty, but that would entail
a rewrite of the driver code (which does OpenGL context initialization
and interaction with the underlying window system and is derived directly from
Mesa example code).

Here's the list of examples:
- test01: drawing a simple triangle with interpolated colors
- test02: drawing a textured quad (the texture is loaded from an external TGA file)
- test03: drawing a static mesh with vertex buffer objects (the mesh is loaded from
  an external Wavefront OBJ file)
