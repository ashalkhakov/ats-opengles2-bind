This project aims to provide a means for developing OpenGL ES 2.0 applications in the ATS programming language.

Status:
  * all OpenGL ES 2.0 API functions are ascribed ATS type signatures
  * three sample programs are known to work on Ubuntu 11.04; these programs are (a) port of Mesa's triangle demo, (b) texture loading from a TGA file, and (c) a not-so-simple Wavefront OBJ mesh loader

Updated (December 22, 2011): see the list of [changes](http://mathdev.org/ru/node/27857).

Note: the TEST/data directory contains some test files. In particular, the files called `inv_weapon2.tga` and `loading.tga` are taken from the Nexuiz project (now called [Xonotic](http://www.xonotic.org/)) and are licensed under GPLv2.
